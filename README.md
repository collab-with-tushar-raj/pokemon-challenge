# Environment File Setup

Please create an environment file `.env` at the root directory level. 

The content of the file should be below:
`DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"`

Prisma requires this.

PS - I have committed the `.env` file as part of this challenge. We should not commit a `.env` file but to view the application properly, I committed it.
